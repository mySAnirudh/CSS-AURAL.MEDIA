     A web document can be rendered by a speech synthesizer. CSS2 allows you to 
attach specific sound style features to specific document elements.
Aural rendering of documents is mainly used by the visually impaired. Some of 
the situations in which a document can be accessed by means of aural rendering 
rather than visual rendering are the following.
 Learning to read
 Training
 Web access in vehicles
 Home entertainment
 Industrial documentation
 Medical documentation
When using aural properties, the canvas consists of a three-dimensional physical 
space (sound surrounds) and a temporal space (one may specify sounds before, 
during, and after other sounds).
The CSS properties also allow you to vary the quality of synthesized speech 
(voice type, frequency, inflection, etc.).
